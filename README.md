## Installation

notes from poetry for installation

```sh
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
Retrieving Poetry metadata

# Welcome to Poetry!

This will download and install the latest version of Poetry,
a dependency and package manager for Python.

It will add the `poetry` command to Poetry's bin directory, located at:

$HOME/.poetry/bin

This path will then be added to your `PATH` environment variable by
modifying the profile files located at:

$HOME/.profile
$HOME/.zshrc

You can uninstall at any time by executing this script with the --uninstall option,
and these changes will be reverted.

Installing version: 1.1.5
  - Downloading poetry-1.1.5-darwin.tar.gz (51.81MB)

Poetry (1.1.5) is installed now. Great!

To get started you need Poetry's bin directory ($HOME/.poetry/bin) in your `PATH`
environment variable. Next time you log in this will be done
automatically.

To configure your current shell run `source $HOME/.poetry/env`
```

$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | POETRY_UNINSTALL=1 python -
# We are sorry to see you go!

This will uninstall Poetry.

It will remove the `poetry` command from Poetry's bin directory, located at:

$HOME/.poetry/bin

This will also remove Poetry from your system's PATH.
